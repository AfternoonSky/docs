# Privacy

Moderation can be a sensitive subject.  Generally on ATProto, the data you create is yours, and public.  But, especially when it comes to harassment, a user might not want the labels they create, or the votes they submit to be published on the network.

When you create a label, we treat that as the platform's label.  That means the AT record shows up in the PDS for @pmsky.social, rather than your own.  It also means that once created, you can no longer delete a label.

When you vote on a label, we only save _that you voted_ on that label, not _how_ you voted.  We also track that someone voted that label up/down, and publish that as a record to the @pmsky.social PDS.



## Future Directions

In the future, we might allow for users to publish these records to their own PDS if they wish to have public votes (e.g. for user-specific labeling, publish X label if Y user(s) voted on it).

Another feature is semi-private voting, where the platform saves how you vote internally to allow you to change your votes.  As-is, voting is irrevocable since we're going for safety & privacy over convenience at first.  If enabled, this would be a setting you can enable, not something you're opted into without notice.
