# Why Peer Moderation?

Moderation usually is done by privileged moderators, and in most cases this is handled entirely by the platform itself. &#x20;

While this is important for any platform, it can also lead to problems when moderation decisions clash with the company's interests, or when the platform is bought by a billionaire with their own ideas of what constitutes free speech.

Bluesky introduced [composable moderation](https://bsky.social/about/blog/4-13-2023-moderation) to augment their moderation capabilities and allow third parties to participate in the moderation process.  This has flourished, with community-specific labelers like [Blacksky](https://bsky.app/profile/blacksky.app), automated models like [Xblock](https://bsky.app/profile/xblock.aendra.dev), and self-labeling like the [Pronouns labeling system](https://bsky.app/profile/pronouns.adorable.mom).

However, third party moderation also has its own drawbacks.  Early on in Bluesky's journey of composable moderation, @aegis.blue gained prominence as one of the first large third-party labelers.  It didn't take long before one of the people behind this labeler was involved in a personal dispute, and ended up abusing their power over the labeler.&#x20;

Whether moderation is done by the platform itself or third-party labelers, in both cases these decisions are made behind closed doors, by small groups of people. &#x20;

PMsky offers a new option, where moderation can happen based on consensus rather than consolidated opinions.
